Coming from Bedrock edition, I was disappointed with how simple geckolib animation controllers were and also how animations override each other instead of blending when they modify the same bone, so I basically just made my own simple animation library.

I also didn't like how I couldn't copy render code from vanilla mobs. It took me 2 months trying to get duck armor to render with geckolib before I finally gave up and used vanilla rendering instead so I could copy the horse's armor renderer.

My animation library is quite messily coded and not yet available as an actual library mod, but if anyone likes it I might clean it up and release it.
